# Overview

This is a project I worked on to better my understanding of the C++ language but also because it was a combination of two of the things I love most, coding and Star Wars. I was particularly interested in learning how to setup different libraries in Visual Studio, and how I could incorporate those into my project. It is a simple project, but my goal was achieved and I have more knowledge and appreciation for the C++ language than I did before. 

This program is a gallery to view info and pictures of different Star Wars characters. The user can also make a list of their favorite characters, to which they can add to or remove from at any time.

# Development Environment

The IDE I used for this project was Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. I developed this project in the C++ language and the libraries I used were:
* JsonCpp (For parsing JSON data)
* OpenCV (For display an image)
* libcurl (To convert the url img source into a viewable object)
* vcpkg (Tool that can be used to install different libraries. I used it to install libcurl)

# Future Work

* Cleanup display of info so it's easier to read.
* Add pictures to the characters that do not have an image.
* Add other menu options to display other info such as planets or starships.
